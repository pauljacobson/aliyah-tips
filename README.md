The tips on this site are things that we learned during our Aliyah Adventure. Don't rely on these tips alone. The various agencies that help make it possible for people to make Aliyah offer fantastic resources that you should always look to first when you need help. These agencies include the following:

1. [Jewish Agency](http://www.jewishagency.org/)
2. [Ministry of Absorption](http://www.moia.gov.il/english/pages/default.aspx)
3. [The Israel Centre](http://www.jewishagency.org/south-africa/program/2396) for South Africans making the move.

Each of these organizations offer invaluable help so look to their resources first. We did and they really made a huge difference to our transition.

The tips we offer are extras that helped us fill in blanks that weren't quite covered by the resources these various agencies made available to us or which helped us get things done a little faster.
